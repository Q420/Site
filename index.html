      <h2>Welcome to Mr. Night's website</h2>
      <p>Mr. Night was created by a mysterious organization known as The Foundation. The Foundation had been working on advanced robotics and artificial intelligence for years, and they saw the potential to use their technology for their own benefit. They had a plan to use Mr. Night's unique abilities to create music for famous artists and embed hidden messages within it.</p>
      <p>His music contains hidden messages and his alien-looking tweets have attracted a cult following.</p>
      <p>However, the people who created him are trying to kill him or take him back and he doesn't want to go.</p>
